#Architecture#
MVVM, Retrofit, testing is done from ViewModel(excl.) to API, functional testing.


#Notes#
I've chosen MVVM mainly due to it is conventional and most devs are use to that. Which makes onboarding of juniors
easier.

I am parsing as much as possible in retrofit prefering default values over null where reasonable.
I do not do any DTO remapping. It would be done only when API would change because it multiplies data types in
project which makes more complex.
...

I would use Retrofit or straight OKHTTP. It would depend how API is defined. Sometimes it can be generated by dynaming
langs which may not respect static typing and then using pojos is not flexible enough. At that point I would use
OKHTTP.

In this case I assumed that API respects static typing thus I used Retrofit.

OK I have spend actually whole day with this task. I've spend about 6:00 hours which exceeds what you wanted.
There is definately lot of info needed about API, which I would ask. I've put TODOs in project.
